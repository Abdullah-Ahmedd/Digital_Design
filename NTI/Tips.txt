the naming rules should be as follows 
try to be descibtive and use _ 
professional teams and most standards prefer lowercase with underscores for example (fa_behavioral) for clarity, consistency, and compatibility.
so for example 
1)if you are making a full adder using structural modeling the file name should be 
full_adder_structural.vhd
2) if you are making a binary adder using generate blocks the file name should be 
binary_adder_generate.vhd
