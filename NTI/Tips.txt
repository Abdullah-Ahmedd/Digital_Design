the naming rules should be as follows 
try to be descibtive and use _ 
professional teams and most standards prefer lowercase with underscores for example (fa_behavioral) for clarity, consistency, and compatibility.
so for example 
1)if you are making a full adder using structural modeling the file name should be 
full_adder_structural.vhd
2) if you are making a binary adder using generate blocks the file name should be 
binary_adder_generate.vhd

if you are not doing a testbench and you want to make the wave show all the possible values in the way you know in the truth table 
A |  B  | C 
  |     |
  |     |
  |     | 
  |     |
  |     |

1) make all signals start with 0 
2) decide a time t (any time is okay)
3) make the time of the least significant variable with that time
4) the variable left to the variable from 3) with 2t and the one left to it by 4t and so on 
so
A time will be 4t
B time will be 2t 
C time will be t 
and so on...
5)then since in the period t every variables toggles t/2 0 (you set it at 1) )
and then t/2 to t from 0 to 1
so if you have 4 variables you will have 16 possible combinations 
but from 5 you will press run only 8 times
